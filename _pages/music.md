## Soundcloud
I make (mostly) instrumental music under the moniker **slow mountain**. 
You can find most of my tracks on my [soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/slow_mountain).

Some of these tracks have been featured in [documentaries](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5578028/), [promotional videos](https://vimeo.com/211065821), and [videogames](http://www.gamedesign.gr/2014/07/02/brokenthe-princes-of-milgra/).

## OP-1 tracks
Towards the end of 2017 I bought one of these beauties:

Since then I have been making several minitracks that you can check out [here](op1tracks).

## Classical percussion
Between 2004 and 2009 I have been performing as a classical percussionist in several cities in mainland Greece, either as part of a percussion ensemble or as part of a symphonic orchestra.
