I was born in Athens, Greece in 1985. From a young age I was drawn to two things: music and computers.

Growing up I decided to pursue both interests, which led me to study Computer Science at the Informatics department of the Athens University of Economics and Business, while travelling back and forth between Athens and my hometown Lamia in order to obtain my diploma as a classical percussionist.

In 2009 I moved to Barcelona with the goal of combining my two interests by joining the Music Technology Group of Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I finished a Master's degree under the supervision of Dr. Hendrik Purwins and a PhD under the supervision of Dr. Esteban Maestre and Dr. Xavier Serra in the field of music information retrieval.

Following my PhD, I worked as a post-doc researcher and R&D software developer for the RAPID-MIX EU project in collaboration with Dr. Sergi Jorda, working as a prototyping and tech transfer specialist in the field of multimodal interaction.
