The  orchestral  timpani are  a  key  component  in  western classical  music,  although  their  weight,  size,  and  fragility make their transportation very difficult. Current commercial  software  synthesizers  for  the  Orchestral  Timpani  are primarily sample-based and work with a MIDI keyboard, giving the user control over the note amplitude and pitch. This  approach  implements  a  virtual  five-piece  set  of  orchestral  timpani,  which  is  controlled  using  a  pressure-sensitive graphics tablet.

This project was carried out as my undergraduate thesis in the [Informatics department](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/infotech-overview-en) of the Athens University of Economics and Business, supervised by [Georgios Papaioannou](http://graphics.cs.aueb.gr/users/gepap/). For more details on the project, check out the [SMC 2010 paper](https://zenodo.org/record/849781).
