An automatic accompaniment system for the singing voice, which allows the user to begin singing from any point within the piece he/she desires. The system is based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm, which is used as both a similarity measure as well as an alignment tool between the live performance and the reference. The userâ€™s position within the piece is initially determined with a variation of current Query by humming/singing methods, based on three sets of acoustic features; pitch trajectory, RMS energy envelope and MFCCs. After locating the user, the system adapts the tempo of the accompaniment utilizing a known on-line DTW method. The system is implemented in MATLAB and Java, while audio playback is handled using Max/MSP.

This project was carried out as my master's thesis in the [Music Technology Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg) of Universitat Pompeu Fabra, supervised by [Hendrik Purwins](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~hpurwins/). For more details on the project, check out the [SMC 2010 paper](https://zenodo.org/record/849781) or [the thesis itself](http://www.mtg.upf.edu/node/2173).
