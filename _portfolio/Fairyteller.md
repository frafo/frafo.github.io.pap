Once upon a time, there were 6 Sonar Knights who decided to build a hack about supporting story telling, with sound...

Fairyteller was developed within 24 hours for [Music Hack Day Barcelona 2014](http://new.musichackday.org/2014/barcelona/). The software analyses different characteristics from a narrator's voice speaking through a microphone input, and then uses them to automagically generate a suitable real-time musical background and soundscape. 

The narrator's vocal characteristics (pitch, loudness) are used to control a real-time algorithmic composition patch made in Pure Data, while a real-time speech-to-text algorithm tracks the narrator's location inside the fairytale text, downloading and reproducing sounds from [Freesound](http://freesound.org) on the fly. 

Fairyteller was created in collaboration with Jorge García, Álvaro Sarasúa, Imanol Gómez, Andrés Bucci and Mathieu Bosi, and won the [GiantSteps](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/giant-steps) prize.
