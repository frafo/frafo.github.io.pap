Artistic performance is, first and foremost, a social experience; it is a means through which the performer(s) can directly interact with the audience. When the performance is a musical composition, that experience is both shaped by the intentions of the composer as well as the performers.

In the case ofmusical ensembles (such as a string quartet), the performers must also interactand coordinate with each other, collaboratively shaping the performance thatwill be mediated to the audience. 

The goal of this prototype is to create an ‘augmented’ chamber music experience, where the interactions between the members of a string quartet are visualized for the audience in real time during the performance. This is achieved through a computational analysis of the performers’ bowing movements and individual audio signals, using state-of-the-art methods developed at the Music Technology Group during my PhD research.
