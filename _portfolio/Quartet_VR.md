This is experiment explores the contribution of auditory and other features to the illusion of plausibility in a virtual environment that depicts the performance of a string quartet. It was carried out in collaboration with Ilias Bergström, Sérgio Azevedo, Nuno Saldanha and Mel Slater.

The VR experience consists of a virtual environment in which the user shares a room with a string quartet, whose movements and sound are driven by data originating from the QUARTET dataset.
