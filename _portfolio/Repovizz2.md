[repovizz2](http://repovizz2.upf.edu/) is an online repository for multimodal data. Originally a refactored version of Universitat Pompeu Fabra's [RepoVizz](http://repovizz.upf.edu), repovizz2 focuses on providing a robust and flexible online service to store, retrieve, and modify multimodal data.

It was created within the context of the [RAPID-MIX](http://rapidmix.goldsmithsdigital.com/) project, as part of a toolchain that enabled an iterative prototyping process based on the Interactive Machine Learning (IML) paradigm; the main focus was the reuse of training data and trained models as part of the prototyping loop.
